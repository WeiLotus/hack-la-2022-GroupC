# This Project
> Link to presentation: 
> Give a brief description of the final product. 
In order to better evaluate each student's engagement in the course, the final product seeks to provide a visualizing and summarizing tool for instructors to describe what the Student's Discussion Activity looks like from the instructor's side.

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
In this project, we use R Shiny, a fantastic R package that allows users to create interactive web apps directly from R! Previous research has demonstrated that discussion is beneficial to learning in all areas because it enables learners to process knowledge rather than merely receiving it. While we investigate the importance of discussion through exploring the provided discussion dataset, we divide our interface functions into three primary components: the number of users and posts every day, Summaries per user, and the rank of top contributors across all discussions. We specifically intend to give instructors an interactive learning analytics tool based on students' participation in course content-related discussions. We would also like to see our designed interface used as an assessment tool for instructors as an enhanced grading technique of students' participation marks.

## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
The most crucial accomplishment is the new exciting technique, for example coding in R Shiny,  that we learned throughout this event. It is never simple to leave one's comfort zone, and at this event, we were constantly encouraged to try new things in such a short period of time. 

We shall brainstorm ahead of time the next time because we spent so much time looking for a plausible idea. Furthermore, we believe it is a good idea to install and to become familiar with the git environment prior to attending the event so that the team can easily track collaborative progress.
